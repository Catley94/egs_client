# egs_client Flutter UI

This is the Flutter UI for the egs_client demo. It can list Unreal projects and engines discovered on your machine and interact with the local Rust HTTP service.

## Unreal Engine on Linux â€” where to download?

Epic does not publish prebuilt Linux editor binaries via the Launcher. The supported way is to link your Epic and GitHub accounts and build from source. See:
- ../docs/UNREAL_LINUX_DOWNLOADS.md
